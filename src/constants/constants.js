A product backlog is prioritized based on the highest value to the customer, not based on cheapest or fastest. Hence, B and D can be eliminated. Option C is the best choice.

All other options talk about some kind of decisions to be taken, which is not justified with the information given in the question. Reviewing and Analysing will help the team understand which actions would help the project the most. Hence, D is the best choice.  Exam tip: For any problems, concerns., issues etc. before taking a decision, it is always better to understand the situation and review/analyse to understand the best possible decisions to be taken in the project. Understand >> Analyse >> Decision."
