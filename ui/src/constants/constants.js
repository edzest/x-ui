      "explanation": "Given the situation, if the team is not able to arrive at the best way to build a work item, the scrum master needs to facilitate and help the team in finalizing the best way. Choosing any other alternative will not help deliver maximum value to the customer. Hence, A can be eliminated. A product backlog is prioritized based on the highest value to the customer, not based on cheapest or fastest. Hence, B and D can be eliminated. Option C is the best choice. (Tip/Mindset: When the team faces an issue, the leader should help them solve that issue, rather than looking for alternatives)"

      "explanation": "Considering your immediate experience of a similar project, you should give estimate: the form of a range.  As a component of a schedule management plan, the level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic duration estimates.  The range accounts for risk contingencies.  These contingencies may be some threats of delay or opportunities to gain efficiencies and accelerate the schedule.  A project in the initiation phase (which is the case in this scenario) might have a rough order of magnitude estimate in the -25 % to + 75 % range.  If you would estimate 8 weeks most likely, a rough range of 4 to 12 weeks is reasonable.  But that range is not among your answer choices.  Later, as more information becomes available, estimates could narrow to a range of +/- 10 %.  In the scenario provided, you have a team that is experienced in this kind of project, making the narrower range of six to ten weeks the best the available choices "

      "correctOptionId": "4",
      "explanation": "The scenario implies you are leading a hybrid project in which the product is being built iteratively while the schedule is controlled using the schedule baseline. This situation can happen when the performing organization is not mature enough with its project management approach. For example, the organization uses tools and techniques that are incompatible with the project processes, incorrectly tailors processes to a project, or implements any other combination of tools or techniques that is inconsistent with the selected development approach or project life cycle. The critical path method is one of the tools and techniques that can be used as part of the Control Schedule process implied by the scenario. However, this method is mainly applicable to projects that are managed using predictive approaches.  With this technique, the project's progress is compared along the critical path to determine the schedule status. A variance between the actual performance and the baseline will have a direct impact on the project end date. When agile approaches are used, e.g., when the product is developed using iterations, as described in the scenario, the Control Schedule process may include backlog reprioritization, iteration retrospectives, velocity calculation, etc.  Evaluating the variance between the schedule baseline and the critical path would not be useful for agile practices and, therefore, should be avoided."
